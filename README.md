# COVID-19 Infection Data Analysis

This project is focused on analyzing the **COVID-19 infection dataset** to extract valuable insights regarding the spread and impact of the pandemic. It includes visualizing infection trends, fatality rates, and recovery statistics. The analysis is performed using **Python** and various data analysis libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessing the COVID-19 dataset by handling missing data and inconsistencies.
- **Data Visualization**: Using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize infection trends, recovery rates, and death rates across different countries and regions.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Analyzing the statistical significance of different factors affecting the spread of the virus.
- **Trend Analysis**: Monitoring how the infection rates change over time.
- **Prediction Models**: Using machine learning techniques (optional, if included) to predict future trends based on historical data.

## Dataset

The COVID-19 dataset used for this analysis contains information on:
- Daily confirmed cases
- Daily deaths
- Daily recoveries
- Country/region-specific data

The dataset can be obtained from publicly available sources such as [Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) or other reliable sources.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running and modifying the provided notebooks.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **SciPy**: For statistical analysis.

### Installing dependencies

To install the necessary Python libraries, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Alfaz-Ahmad/Covid19_infection_Data_Analysis.git
   cd Covid19_infection_Data_Analysis
   ```

2. Download the COVID-19 dataset and place it in the `data/` folder.

3. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder to start exploring the data:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Run the scripts in the `src/` folder for specific tasks such as generating visualizations or analyzing trends.

## Visualizations

The project includes several types of visualizations such as:

- Line charts showing the spread of COVID-19 over time.
- Bar charts comparing infection rates between different countries.
- Heatmaps showing infection severity in various regions.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate machine learning models for predicting future trends in COVID-19 cases.
- Add interactive dashboards using Plotly or Dash for real-time data visualization.
- Incorporate vaccine data to compare the effects of vaccination on infection rates.
