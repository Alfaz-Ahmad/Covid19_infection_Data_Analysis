The data analysis highlights a clear trend where both infection and death rates are high in developed countries with high GDP. This pattern suggests that while developed nations may have strong economies and advanced healthcare systems, factors such as high population density, increased global travel, and greater social mobility may contribute to the higher infection rates. The corresponding high death rates, despite access to better healthcare, could be influenced by factors like the strain on healthcare systems during widespread outbreaks, aging populations, or the presence of underlying health conditions. These findings emphasize the need for comprehensive public health strategies in developed countries to better manage both infection spread and mortality rates during pandemics.
